## Functionality

* 4: All stories are complete ahead of schedule and students submit a plan for what they will do with the remaining time.
* 3: All stories complete.
* 2: Six stories complete
* 1: Fewer than six stories complete.

## Code Quality

* 4: Students have prepared at least two diagrams to show the classes that are used in the response to a specific request in their application starting at the controller level. Students can speak to the specific responsibilities of each of the classes in their diagrams and are able to defend the choices they made when organizing their code. The diagrams and the code itself demonstrate that the students have carefully considered the implications of the choices they have made. Classes, methods, and variables are well named and communicate to someone new to the codebase the intent of and relationship between classes, methods, variables, etc.
* 3: Students have prepared at least two diagrams as described above, but may not fully be able to describe or defend the choices they made. The code itself is still clean and generally readable, but occasionally require explanation.
* 2: While the code that students have prepared works, students may have either not prepared diagrams, or the decisions made in the project may be difficult to defend under instructor scrutiny.
* 1: Students have not prepared diagrams and the code that they have prepared is likely difficult for the instructor to understand.

## Testing

* 4: Students have installed a means to measure test coverage, and are able to demonstrate that coverage is over 90%. Code is designed and tests implemented so that models that rely on API calls can be tested without making those API calls. Students have used strategies or tools so that tests that are not designed specifically to test the ability to make API calls do not make those API calls.
* 3: Students have installed a means to measure test coverage, and are able to demonstrate that coverage is over 90%.
* 2: Students have either not installed a tool to measure test coverage, or test coverage is lower than 90%
* 1: Test coverage is obviously lacking.
