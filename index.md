## Overview

This project is designed to provide you an opportunity to explore a number of APIs. The goal of the project is not that you will become particularly familiar with any single API, but rather that by consuming a variety of APIs you will start to see the more general patterns that exist. The most important skills that you will be practicing in this project are:

* Reading documentation,
* Writing clean Ruby code,
* Organizing your code using different layers of abstraction so that it is easy to explain the organization of your application, and
* Being flexible in the way that you organize your code so that the classes you use make sense given the specific task you are trying to accomplish.

This last one is particularly important. In the past you may have gotten used to using exactly the classes that Rails prescribed. In this project, we expect you to make your own decisions about how code should be organized. Remember, you are in charge of the framework, the framework is not in charge of you.
